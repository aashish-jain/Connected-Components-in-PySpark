# Connected-Components-in-PySpark
Connected Component algorithm (https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub43122) implemented using PySpark

Assumptions:
1. The graph is represented by a list of edges in the form "source target" given in every line, where source is integer representing source vertex id and target is integer representing target vertex id.
2. The graph has no self-loops (i.e. source = target).
